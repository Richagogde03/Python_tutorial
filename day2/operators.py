# 1. arithmetic operator
# +,-,%,/,*,**,//
# print(3+5)
# print(9%3)
# print(2**3)


# 2. assignment operators
# a = 4
# a += 1
# print(a)
# a *=3
# print(a)
# a **= 2
# print(a)


# 3. Comparison operator
# num1 = 2
# num2 = 4
# print(num1 == num2)
# print(num1 != num2)
# print(num1 < num2)
# print(num1 <= num2)


# 4. Logical operators
# --> AND (both should be true for true answer)
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a > 5 and b < 10)

# # --> OR (one of the answer should be truee)
# print(a>5 or b<10)

# # --> not
# print(not(a > 5 and b < 10))


# 5. Identity operator, is and is not
# x = ["apple", "banana"]
# y = ["apple", "banana"]
# z = x

# print(x is z)
# print(x is y)
# print(x == y)


# 6. Membership operator, in and not in
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
# x = ["apple", "banana", "lichi", "cherry"]
# print("cherry" in x)


# 7. bitwise operator
# this are used to compare binary numbers
a = 6

print(e)
f = ~(a)
print(f)
g = a << 2
